Project Objective
Stock market data can be interesting to analyze and as a further incentive, strong predictive models can have large financial payoff. The amount of financial data on the web is seemingly endless. A large and well structured dataset on a wide array of companies can be hard to come by. In this project I have used a dataset with historical stock prices (5 years) for all companies currently found on the S&P 500 index. Action Items -
In this project I have run multiple regression models to identify the best model to fit the dataset.
I have downloaded the S&P 500 stocks from 2013 to 2018
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (FAANG) stocks
I have plotted the yearly performance for the FAANG stocks
The key parameters have been explained using graphical representation of data.
I have run multiple regression models and compared them to find the best model for this dataset
For the best model I evaluated on a test dataset and report the r2 value and represent it visually.
